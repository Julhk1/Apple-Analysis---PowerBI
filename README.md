📉 2. Apple Stock Price Variation Over the Years:
I’ve also analyzed Apple’s stock price variation from 1990 to today. The remarkable growth in Apple’s stock reflects the company’s resilience in the tech market. For example, from $136 in 2020 to $225 today, the stock has experienced significant growth despite periods of volatility.

🔍 3. Financial Analysis of the Last 5 Years:
To gain deeper insights into the company’s financial health, I’ve compared several key financial ratios of Apple against industry averages:
Gross Margin: 0.42 (an increase of 3.65% above the industry average)
Net Profit Margin: 0.24
Return on Equity (ROE): 1.25, showcasing Apple’s ability to generate significant profits from shareholders’ equity.
Return on Investment (ROI): 0.45, well above the industry norm.
These indicators show that Apple remains an undisputed leader in terms of profitability and efficiency.

💼 4. Net Income and Margins Analysis:
The charts below highlight Apple’s performance over the last four years:
Net Income: In 2023, Apple generated $97K, a slight decline from $100K in 2022 but still higher than 2020’s $57K.
Gross Margin and Net Margin: Apple’s margins remain stable and strong, with progressive increases, demonstrating effective cost management.

🧐 My Analysis:
Apple continues to grow impressively, particularly in terms of profitability and value creation for shareholders. However, the slight decline in net income in 2023 could prompt reflection on cost structure shifts or recent macroeconomic impacts. This analysis shows that Apple’s strong gross margin supports its ability to maintain high financial performance in a complex market environment.

I’m convinced that combining real-time data with financial ratio analysis is essential for making informed decisions and staying competitive. 💡
